## About
Welcome! I am a Senior Research Engineer at [Cornell University](https://astro.cornell.edu/andrew-mullen) in the [Planetary Habitability & Technology Lab](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu). Prior to this I was a [NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Scholar](https://cos.gatech.edu/article/andrew-mullen) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
I received a PhD in Electrical Engineering and a MS in Oceanography from the University of California San Diego while conducting research at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu), and a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.
<br><br>
My research focuses on developing tools for earth and space exploration, with an emphasis on building custom scientifc instruments for extreme environments. 
These efforts have allowed me to work on highly interdisciplinary engineering-science teams. I have had a focus on optical and elelctical engineering, while also contributing to mechanical and software development.
<br><br>
Examples of past and ongoing work include: 

* [Underwater Imaging Systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12093): development of a custom submersible diver operated microscope, an underwater particle imaging velocimetry system, and a submersible digital holographic microscope
* [Icefin Underwater Robot](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu/icefin/?playlist=1769ca3&video=6f76132): member of the operations and development team of Icefin, a custom remotely operated underwater vehicle designed for polar exploration
* [Life Detection Payloads](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/aca6ed): development of conceptual life detection payloads and mission concepts to "ocean worlds" such as Europa 

Results from this work have been published or are forthcoming in:

* [Journals](https://andrewdmullen.github.io/publications) including: *Nature*, *Nature Geoscience*, *Nature Communications*, *Planetary Science Journal*  
* [Media](https://andrewdmullen.github.io/media) outlets including: *The New York Times*, *BBC*, *Washington Post*
<br>

These projects I have had the opportunity to conduct a variety of field work including:

* Field research seasons in: Antarctica (x3), the Arctic (x2), Red Sea (x2), Caribbean (x2), and West Africa (x2)
* Performing research: as a scientific diver, aboard research vessels, and utilizing remotely operated vehilces (ROVs). 

Outside of work I enjoy surfing, backpacking, and triathalons.
