Welcome!  I am an engineer who works on developing tools for earth and space exploration, with an emphasis on building custom scientific instruments for extreme environments. These efforts have allowed me to work on highly interdisciplinary engineering-science teams. I have a focus on optical and electrical engineering, while also contributing to mechanical and software development.


### Professional
I currently work as a Senior Research Engineer at [Cornell University](https://astro.cornell.edu/andrew-mullen) in the [Planetary Habitability & Technology Lab](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu). Prior to this, I was a [NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow](https://cos.gatech.edu/article/andrew-mullen) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. During my Ph.D. I conducted research at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the [Jaffe Laboratory for Underwater Imaging](https://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu).

* Icefin Underwater Robot: member of the operations and development team of Icefin, a custom remotely operated underwater vehicle designed for polar exploration
* Life Detection Payloads: development of conceptual life detection payloads and concept missions to explore "ocean worlds" in our solar system such as Europa 

### Technical Skills
* Computing: data analysis, image processing, computer vision [*Python*, *Matlab*]
* Electrical: PCB design,  implementation of embedded computers and micro-controllers [*Eagle*, *Python*]
* Mechanical: mechanical design, pressure housing design [*Solid Works*]
* Optical: imaging systems, microscopy, holography, computational imaging
* Fluidic: particle tracking velocimetry observations, fluid dynamics, water sampling systems

### [Field Work](https://andrewdmullen.github.io/fieldwork/)

* Conducted field research seasons in: Antarctica (x3), the Arctic (x3), the Red Sea (x2), the Caribbean (x2), West Africa (x2), and the Pacific. 
* Performed research utilizing: scientific diving, research vessels, underwater robotic vehicles, towed ocean payloads, and geophysical instrumentation.


[Outside of work](https://andrewdmullen.github.io/hobbies/) I enjoy surfing, backpacking, and triathalons (and in 2022 completed my first Ironman in Arizona!).
