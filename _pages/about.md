Welcome! I am a Senior Research Engineer at [Cornell University](https://astro.cornell.edu/andrew-mullen) in the [Planetary Habitability & Technology Lab](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu). Prior to this, I was a [NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow](https://cos.gatech.edu/article/andrew-mullen) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
I received a PhD in Electrical Engineering (2018) and a MS in Oceanography (2015) from the University of California San Diego while conducting research at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu). I completed a BS in Civil Engineering (2011) from the University of Notre Dame.
<br><br>
My research focuses on developing tools for earth and space exploration, with an emphasis on building custom scientific instruments for extreme environments. 
These efforts have allowed me to work on highly interdisciplinary engineering-science teams. I have a focus on optical and electrical engineering, while also contributing to mechanical and software development.
