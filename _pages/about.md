Welcome, I am a research engineer with a focus on developing imaging and robotic systems for exploration. I have a background working with interdisciplinary teams to build and deploy instruments in a variety of challenging polar and marine environments. 

<!---
My work uses systems engineering to design instruments which integrate optical, electrical, mechanical, and software components.

Research engineer with a focus on developing imaging and robotic systems for exploration.

My work uses systems engineering to integrate optical, electrical, mechanical, and software components - with the ultimate goal of creating new imaging and robotic tools for exploration.

Welcome, I am a research engineer with experience developing custom tools for earth and space science. I have acted as both a leader and member of interdisciplinary teams building and deploying instruments in harsh polar and marine environments. My work uses systems engineering to integrate optical, electrical, mechanical, and software components in order to create new tools for exploration. 

My work focuses on collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to take ideas from concept to instruments deployed in extreme environments.

### Professional
I worked as a Senior Research Engineer at [Cornell University](https://astro.cornell.edu/andrew-mullen) in the [Planetary Habitability & Technology Lab](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu). Prior to this, I was a [NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow](https://cos.gatech.edu/article/andrew-mullen) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. During my Ph.D. I conducted research at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the [Jaffe Laboratory for Underwater Imaging](https://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu).
