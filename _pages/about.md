Welcome! I am currently a Senior Research Engineer at [Cornell University](https://astro.cornell.edu/andrew-mullen) in the [Planetary Habitability & Technology Lab](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu). Prior to this I was a [NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Scholar](https://cos.gatech.edu/article/andrew-mullen) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
I received a PhD in Electrical Engineering and a MS in Oceanography from the University of California San Diego while conducting research at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu), and a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of Notre Dame.
<br><br>
My research focuses on developing tools for earth and space exploration, with an emphasis on building custom scientifc instruments for extreme environments. 
These efforts have allowed me to work on highly interdisciplinary engineering-science teams. I have had a focus on optical and elelctical engineering, while also contributing to mechanical and software development.
<br><br>
Examples of past and ongoing work include: development of custom [submersible diver operated microscope](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12093), development of submersible holographic microscope for motility detection, operations and development team member on the [underwater robot Icefin](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu/icefin/?playlist=1769ca3&video=6f76132), development of conceptual [life detection payloads](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/aca6ed) for planetary missions to "ocean worlds" such as Europa. Results from this work have been published or are forthcoming in journals including *Nature*, *Nature Geoscience*, *Nature Communications*, *Planetary Science Journal*,  and a variety of media outlets.
<br><br>
Through these projects I have had the opportunity to conduct field research in Antarctica, the Arctic, Red Sea, Carribean, and West Africa. 
As well as work conduct research as a scientific diver, aboard research vessels, and utilizing remotely operated vehilces (ROVs). Outside of work I enjoy surfing, backpacking, and endurance athletics.
