# Polar Field Work Packing List: Personal Clothing & Gear

## General Clothing Advice

* Advice
	* Use a layering system that offers flexibility to keep you warm, but also the ability to wick away sweat and remove layers when you are active.
	* Make sure nothing is too tight, you want to have good circulation and mobility. Insulation comes from trapping warm air and overly tight clothes can restrict circulation which is very bad.
	* Make sure you try all your layers on at the same time to ensure they fit well together.
	* Double check if there is any chance it ever rains or sleets where you are going, especially if near the coast. If so bring a watery shell layer.
	* If you will be snow mobiling make sure you can cover any exposed skin on your face and neck
	* ECW - Stands for Extreme Cold Weather clothing.

* Layering System
	1. Base (wool, synthetic) — Wicks sweat away from your skin and adds some warm but insulation is not its primary purpose.  I prefer light or mid-weight base layers, 
	2. Breathable Insulating (wool, fleece, active fleece) — Provides insulation while also being breathable, allowing you to wear them during high energy output activities.
	3. Puffy Insulating (down, synthetic down) — Provides insulation and traps lots of warm air while being lightweight. Also provides some wind protection.
	4. Shell (soft shell, hard shell) — Provides wind and abrasion resistance. Soft shells are breathable and stretchy while providing some water resistance. Hard shells are water proof but less breathable.
	5. Extreme Cold Weather (ECW) / Parka — Outer layer worn when it is very cold as well as while snowmobiling. Designed to provide the most possible warmth, but can get too warm during high energy output activities.

## Packing Advice

- Gear Tips:
	- Sew or tie small rope loops to gloves and beanies etc. so you can carabiner them if you are not wearing them.
	- Bring a backpack with room for extra computers, electronics, batteries.  You may have to carry team electronics and these could be given to you somewhat last minute.
	- Pack  an extra (expandable) duffel in case you need to bring more stuff or one of your bags breaks. (Such as items from a base gift shop).
	- Have a number of stuff sacks to organize your belongings within the larger bag.
	- Have carabiners for each bag so you can easily secure them to something heavy on the ice.
	- Bring double of anything small and important (watch, leatherman, etc.) so you have a backup in case the primary one is lost or breaks.
	- Bring a small paper organizer or a few folders to keep important documents organized.
	- Check if the program will store bags while you are on the ice, if so you can leave a bag of fresh clothes for when you fly back into New Zealand / South America / South Africa.
	- Bring down postcards with you to send to family and friends from Antarctica. The base may have postcards but sometimes these are limited. At McMurdo you can send and receive mail.
	- Clean your boots and other gear so they do not get stopped by biosecurity when traveling internationally (especially for New Zealand).

- Home Preparation: 
	- Two Factor Authentication (for bank, email, etc.) — Your cell phone will not work so ensure you or someone else can get into your accounts if needed without requiring a text message. Usually you can download backup codes as a means for two factor authentication without a cell phone.
	- Bills — Make sure your bills (rent, car, internet, phone, etc.) are getting paid.
	- Phone plan — If you cancel your plan or put it on hold double check that your phone number will not be given away (this happened to me and was a major hassle).
	- Physical Mail - Have it held or forwarded to a different address.
	- Email - Setup auto response that you are out of contact.
	- Voting — If you will be gone during an election cycle submit your ballot early.
	- Home — It is a good idea to have someone check on your house while you are gone. And to pack up your things nicely. (One season my roof collapsed while I was gone).
	- Plants & Animals — Make a plan for taking care of them.
	- Return From Ice — Your departure date from Antarctic is likely to change so do not make any firm plans within several weeks of your scheduled return from the ice.
