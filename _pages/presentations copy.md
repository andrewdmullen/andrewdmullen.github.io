# Research Engineer & Post Doctoral Fellow

## Icefin Robot 
* Pictures: Icefin in Water, Deployment at Thwaites 
* Description - [Icefin Homepage](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu/icefin/?playlist=1769ca3&video=6f76132)
	* Icefin is a custom robotic vehicle developed for under-ice ocean exploration.  
	* It is equipped with an extensive suite of ocean sensors, and can be deployed through narrow holes melted through glaciers.
	* NASA funded Icefin development to test technology for future exploration of ocean worlds such as Europa. NSF funded additional field research using Icefin to study ocean processes impacting glacial melting and sea level rise.
* Contributions
	* As a member of the Icefin team I contributed to testing and development as well as extensive field operations and logistics.
	* Conducted three field seasons in Antarctica, working on five field research projects: 
		* 2018-19: Ross Ice Shelf & Europa Underwater Probe (RISEUP)
		* 2019-20: International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC)
		* 2021-22: HiPSMI - Ocean Supercooling Study, Scott Base Bathymetric Survey, Kamb Ice Stream
* Outcomes
	* Icefin collected critical ocean data in unexplored regions beneath the Thwaites Glacier and Kamb Ice Stream.  
	* Vehicle data is revealing pivitol processes impacting glacial melting and global sea level rise.
	* Demonstrated deploying robotics through hundereds of meters of ice, an important step for ocean worlds exploration.

## VERNE: Vertical Entry Robot for Navigating Europe
* Pictures: SSSLOW, from ASCEND paper, maybe Frances logo)
* Description
	* Europa is a moon of Jupiter covers by an approximately 15-30 km thick ocean, below which lies a deep liquid ocean
	* VERNE is a NASA funded conceptual mission plan to melt through the ice shell of  Europa in order to search for life as well as study the ice and ocean.
* Contributions
    * Co-led a team of 21 scientists and engineers developing a conceptual life detection science payload (SSSLOW).
    * Contributed to the research and design of the VERNE melt probe.
* Outcomes
	* Developed framework for a Europa sub-surface life detection package combining multiple types of instruments.
	* Produced a detailed survey of existing relevant life detecition technologies from ocean, earth and space science. 
	* Team developed a conceptual multi-stage ice melting probe and mission.
	* Co-Authored Publications: [Lawrence (co-lead), Mullen (co-lead), et al. Planetary Science Journal 2023](https://doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/aca6ed), [Bryson et al. AIAA ASCEND 2020](https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2020-4061), Bryson et al. Earth and Space Science (accepted)
