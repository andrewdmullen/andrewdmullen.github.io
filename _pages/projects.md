* *Description*: Icefin is a modular underwater robot (130 kg, 23 cm diameter, 3.5 m length)  designed for under-ice exploration. It is a tool for polar research, as well as a NASA funded project advancing technologies for future exploration of ocean worlds such as Europa. The robot integrates perception (sonar, imaging), ocean sensors (CTD, DO), navigation (IMU, ADCP), onboard battery power, and 5 DOF thruster actuation. - [Icefin Homepage](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu/icefin/?playlist=1769ca3&video=6f76132), [Thwaites 'Melt' Project](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu/thwaites-melt/) 

* *Contributions*: As an engineer on the Icefin team, I collaborated with interdisciplinary teams (3 to 9 members) to test, develop, and deploy robot. Executed 50+ sub-ice robotic missions (~8 hours each, surveys up to 2km+ long and 800m+ deep). Conducted techincal vehicle deployments through narrow holes (~35cm) drilled through up to 600m of glacier ice. Developed standard operating procedures, checklist protocols, and hazard assessments.

* *Field Seasons*: Conducted three field seasons in Antarctica, working on five projects (totaling 38+ weeks). Operated in harsh weather (-25°C to 0°C), at remote resource-constrained tent camps (up to 1300 km from station), accessed by planes, for up to 5 weeks at a time.
	* 2018-19: Ross Ice Shelf & Europa Underwater Probe (RISEUP)
	* 2019-20: International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC)
	* 2021-22: HiPSMI - Ocean Supercooling Study, Scott Base Bathymetric Survey, Kamb  Ice Stream
	
* *Outcomes*: The Icefin team collected ocean data in previously inaccesible regions beneath Antarctic glaciers. Surveys revealed key processes impacting ice melt, providing critical data for modeling sea level rise. Concurrently, deployments beneath ice shelves demonstrated important capabilities for future ocean worlds exploration.

* *Description*: This project developed a submersible DHM for the Icefin ROV. Holography is a computational imaging technique used to record a three dimensional volume. The submersible DHM uses this approach at small scale to observe microbial motility in the ocean.

* *Contribution*: Concieved project, led collaboration between Georgia Tech & NASA JPL, and secured funding ($160k+ NASA NPP proposal, 15 page competitive grant). Led development of instrument including compact microscopic optics (camera, laser, lenses), electromechanics (pressure vessel, embedded computing), and image processing software (Python/OpenCV, particle tracking). Integrated DHM with Icefin robot, deployed system in Antarctica, and analyzed data.

* *Outcomes*: DHM achivied high resolution (<1 µm) underwater, while having a compact form factor (~35 cm length x 16 cm diameter) allowing integration with Icefin. Deployed in sub-ice Antarctic waters (1.8 °C water, 400 m) as an analog for future “ocean world” exploration. Observed in situ microbial motility as a life detection signature.
