## Research Engineer & Post Doctoral Fellow

### Icefin Underwater Robot
* Engineer on three Antarctic campaigns deploying custom underwater robot ‘Icefin’.  Optimized mechanical operations, coordinated vehicle launches, and troubleshot system issues. Team surveyed previously inaccessible sub-glacial ocean environments providing critical measurements for modeling sea level rise. <br>

### Submersibale Digital Holographic Microscope (DHM)
* Led collaboration with Georgia Tech & NASA JPL developing a submersible DHM for the Icefin ROV. Instrument integrates optical, mechanical, electrical, and embedded computing elements. DHM observed microbial life in Antarctica an analog for future “ocean world” exploration. <br>

### Subsurface Science & Search for Life on Ocean Worlds 
* Co-led design conceptual payload for future NASA mission to the moon Europa. Coordinated 10+ member team, surveying state-of-the-art technologies from earth and space science. Presented framework for integrating tools into multi-sensor life-detection package.

## Graduate Student Researcher

### Benthic Underwater Microscope
* Jointly developed, first system to image seafloor subjects such as corals underwater at micron-scale. Payload integrates optics, illumination, focus tunable lens, and electronics into a submersible package. Applied system to study coral behavior and bleaching in natural environments.

### Micro-Particle Tracking Velocimetry
* Enhanced underwater microscope to measure micro-scale fluid dynamics. Implemented dark-field illumination with precision timing, and developed particle tracking code. Measured viscous boundary layer surrounding coral polyps and perform Fourier analysis of fluctuating velocity fields.

### Towed Microscope 
* Engineering lead on integration and deployment of towed microscopic imaging system. Deployed system to investigate the transport and dispersion of eggs following mass Grouper spawning. 

## Undergraduate

### Groundwater Hydrology, Benin Africa
* Conducted hydrology measurements at remote field sites to study costal saltwater intrusion. Lead small international team in field work, taught sampling methods, designed low-cost hydraulic field instruments, analyzed groundwater models. (Advisor: Dr. Stephen Silliman)


### NOAA Hollings Scholar, University of Alaska Fairbanks
* Prepared and deployed ocean gliders and HF radars collecting data for pollution spill models in Arctic Ocean. (Advisor: Dr. Tom Weingartner)
