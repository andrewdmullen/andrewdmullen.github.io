* *Description*: Icefin is a modular underwater robot designed for under-ice exploration, and capable of being deployed through narrow holes drilled through glaciers. It is a tool for polar research, as well as a NASA funded project advancing technologies for future exploration of ocean worlds such as Europa. - [Icefin Homepage](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu/icefin/?playlist=1769ca3&video=6f76132), [Thwaites 'Melt' Project](https://schmidt.astro.cornell.edu/thwaites-melt/) 

* *Contributions*: As an engineer on the Icefin team, I contributed to system testing and development, as well as extensive field operations and logistics. I conducted three field seasons in Antarctica, working on five projects:
	* 2018-19: Ross Ice Shelf & Europa Underwater Probe (RISEUP)
	* 2019-20: International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC)
	* 2021-22: HiPSMI - Ocean Supercooling Study, Scott Base Bathymetric Survey, Kamb  Ice Stream
	
* *Outcomes*: The Icefin team collected ocean data in previously inaccesible regions beneath Antarctic glaciers. Surveys revealed key processes impacting ice melt, providing critical data for modeling sea level rise. Concurrently, deployments beneath ice shelves demonstrated important capabilities for future ocean worlds exploration.
