## Field Work - Identify Complexities & Challenges

- Who
	- Interdisciplinary Teams: science, engineering, operations, logistics -- coordinate members, contribute in multiple roles
	- International Teams: institutions, countries, cultures, operating protocols -- coordinate stakeholders, work across cultures

- What
	- Technical Equipment: instrumentation, robotics, vehicles, personal equipment -- e.g. science sensors, ROVs, boats, scuba gear
	- Technical Operations: multi-operator teams, techincal skill set -- e.g. deploy, position, monitor, control, coordinate across teams

- Where
	- Harsh Environment: temperature, weather, wind, current, terrain -- e.g. polar, crevassed icefield, at sea, underwater
	- Isolated / Confined Environment: living conditions, travel challenges, resource constraints -- e.g. field camp, aboards ship

- When
	- Constrained Time Windows: constrained operational timelines -- e.g. time limitations during diving, robotic work
	- Long Durations: extended duration -- e.g. extended field seasons, extend single missions
	- Unpredictable Environment: weather, delays -- adapt to environment such e.g. waves, wind, storms, travel delays

## Field Work - Logistics Checklists
